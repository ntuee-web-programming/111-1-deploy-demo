# web programming 111-1 project deployment demo

## Docker intorduction

### Benefits

#### Consistent environments

Docker allows developers to package up their applications and all of their dependencies into a single, self-contained unit that can be easily run on any machine. This ensures that the application will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

#### Easy collaboration and sharing

Docker makes it easy to share and collaborate on applications by allowing developers to publish Docker images to registry services, such as Docker Hub. This allows other developers to easily download and run the same exact environment that was used to develop and test the application.

#### Easy scaling

Docker allows developers to easily scale their applications by running multiple containers on the same host or on multiple hosts. This makes it easy to add more capacity to an application by simply starting up additional containers.

#### Reduced overhead

Because Docker containers are lightweight and share the host operating system, they require fewer resources and have lower overhead than traditional virtual machines. This makes it possible to run more applications on the same hardware, which can save money and improve resource utilization.

#### Improved security

Docker provides several features that can improve the security of applications, such as the ability to run containers with limited permissions and the ability to apply security updates to the host operating system without restarting the containers.

#### container vs. virtual machine

- VM
  - emulates the whole operating system on top of virtual hardware
- container
  - does not emulate any computer, the virtual environment use the host machines's kernel via the docker engine
  - faster to start and stop
  - uses the resources more effectively

### terms

#### image

An image of the container, works like that of a operating system

#### container

A running virtual environment, based on an image

### Quick commands

#### Run a new container

- New Image - `docker run IMAGE`
- Name Container and Launch Image - `docker run --name CONTAINER IMAGE`
- Map Container Ports and Launch Image -`docker run -p HOSTPORT:CONTAINERPORT IMAGE`
- Map ALL Ports and Launch Image - `docker run -P IMAGE`
- Launch Image as Background Service - `docker run -d IMAGE`
- Map Local Directory and Launch - `docker run -v HOSTDIR:TARGETDIR IMAGE`

#### Manage Containers

- List RUNNING Containers - `docker ps`
- List ALL containers - `docker ps -a`
- Delete container - `docker rm CONTAINER`
- Delete a Running Container - `docker rm -f CONTAINER`
- Stop Container - `docker stop CONTAINER`
- Start Container - `docker start CONTAINER`
- Copy File FROM container - `docker cp CONTAINER:SOURCE TARGET`
- Copy File TO container - `docker cp TARGET CONTAINER:SOURCE`
- Start Shell inside container - `docker exec -it CONTAINER bash`
- Rename container - `docker rename OLD NEW`
- Create new Image from Container - `docker commit CONTAINER`

#### Manage Images

- Download Image - `docker pull IMAGE[:TAG]`
- Upload Image to repository - `docker push IMAGE`
- Delete Image - `docker rmi IMAGE`
- List Images - `docker images`
- Build Image from Docker file - `docker build DIRECTORY`
- Tag Image IMAGE - `docker tag IMAGE NEWIMAGE:TAG`

#### Troubleshooting and Information

- Show logs - `docker logs CONTAINER`
- Show stats - `docker stats`
- Show processes - `docker top CONTAINER`
- Show modified files - `docker diff CONTAINER`
- Show mapped ports - `docker port CONTAINER`

### add necessary scripts

#### in the root directory

1. add a script at the project's root that install packages in frontend and backend with the option `--frozen-lockfile`
2. add a script that runs the `build` command in `./frontend`
3. add a script that runs the `deploy` command in `./backend`

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "install:prod": "cd frontend && yarn install --frozen-lockfile && cd ../backend && yarn install --frozen-lockfile",
    "build": "cd frontend && yarn build",
    "deploy": "cd backend && yarn deploy"
  },
  ...
}
```

#### in the backend directory

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "server": "nodemon server.js --ext js --exec babel-node",
    "deploy": "NODE_ENV=production babel-node server.js"
  },
  ...
}
```

`NODE_ENV=production` works on normal operating systems such as the linux environment in the docker container we use. If you want to test this out on a weird operating system which often cause compatibility issues, you should add this entry to your `scripts`.

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "deploy-win": "set NODE_ENV=production&&babel-node server.js"
  },
  ...
}
```

Yes, I am talking about Windows. Be careful about the spaces around `&&`, Windows will take the extra space before `&&` and mess up your `NODE_ENV`. Weird.

### set up api root path and websocket in production environment

`process.env.NODE_ENV` equals to `"production"` when running `yarn build` (`react-scripts build`). Notice that the way the websocket URL is set, it is different from normal http URLs.

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

const API_ROOT =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "/api" : "http://localhost:4000/api";

const WS_URL =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
    ? window.location.origin.replace(/^http/, "ws")
    : "ws://localhost:4000";

export const api = axios.create({ baseURL: API_ROOT });
export const ws = new WebSocket(WS_URL);
```

### serve the output folder with backend

The default path of the output folder for `react-scripts build` is `./frontend/build`.

```javascript
import path from "path";

import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";

const app = express();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  const __dirname = path.resolve();
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../frontend", "build")));
  app.get("/*", function (req, res) {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../frontend", "build", "index.html"));
  });
}
```

### make your backend listen on $PORT in production

If you are starting a server, you need to use the `PORT` environment variable. This is how Railway can expose your deployment. If you see a "Bad Gateway" error, you most likely are not listening on `PORT`. This environment variable is given by Railway, **you don't need to add `PORT` to your .env file**.

```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 4000;
```

### disable development specific settings

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  app.use(cors());
}
```

### add a Dockerfile at the project's root

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

EXPOSE ${PORT}

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN corepack enable
RUN yarn install:prod
RUN yarn build

CMD ["yarn", "deploy"]
```

## Environment variables on Railway

It is a bad practice to put your `.env` file anywhere online. You should instead add environment variables via the "variables" tab on Railway.

## Environment variables on Render

Similar to Render, you can configure your environment variables in the "Environment" tab.
